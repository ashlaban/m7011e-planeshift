	You have successfully joined a plane. A plane is a virtual space you can customize for your needs by using a module. Many users can be connected to a plane at the same time and share its resources. This particular plane doesn't do much other than display this message. Try connecting to a plane using a different module under 'Planes -> List' above,

<h2>Some samples</h2>
<p>
	There are two other planes set up to showcase some of the fuctionality. The first one is using a module to help keep track of resources in the borad game Settlers of Catan. The module is storing data on the plane so that you can save it between game sessions should you need to. Click <a href="/planes/name/Settlers%20Demo%20Room">here</a> to visit the plane.
</p>
<p>
	The other sample is a dice roller application. What sets it aside other dice rollers is that it keep track of users connected to the plane, and displays the dice result for the last user that rolled. This plane is useful for (among other things) role playing games where all players should see the result of a dice roll. Click <a href="/planes/name/Astral%20Plane">here</a> to visit the plane.

<p>
	These are just samples of two planes with simple funtionality, yet they show that with tools like plane data storage and access to connected users some powerful applications can be created. Click About and read the Modules section to learn more about how custom modules can be created to augument many kinds of activities.
