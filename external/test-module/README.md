The Planeshift official demo module used for the tutorial plane. Check it out [here](/planes/name/test-plane)!

You should never _need_ to instantiate a plane of this module, but feel free to should you wish. The plane will show a new user how to interact with the page, how to create a plane, create a module and so on.

It also provides links to further reading for [module developers](/dev-guide).
